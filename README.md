<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Murtajiz!</h1>

I'm passionate about crafting web and mobile applications, diving into UI/UX design, and honing my problem-solving skills to become a proficient developer. As a recent graduate in Computer Science from Florida International University, I'm eagerly seeking opportunities to collaborate on projects that push boundaries and spark innovation.

<h2>About Me</h2>
Driven by creativity, curiosity, and critical thinking, I aspire to excel as a software engineer. I'm into learning new things and tinkering with new tools, as you can tell from the wide array of technologies used in some of my projects. As of recently, I've been experimenting with different AI and Cloud tools to enhance some of my projects.

<h2>Get in Touch</h2>
I'm always open to new collaborations and conversations. Please feel free to reach out via email to explore potential projects and partnerships.

Let's build something awesome together :)
