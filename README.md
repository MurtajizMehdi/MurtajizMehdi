<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Murtajiz!</h1>h1>

I'm passionate about crafting web and mobile applications, diving into UI/UX design, and honing my problem-solving skills to become a proficient developer. Currently pursuing Computer Science at Florida International University, I'm eagerly seeking opportunities to collaborate on full-stack web and mobile projects that push boundaries and spark innovation.

<h2>About Me</h2>
Driven by creativity, curiosity, and critical thinking, I aspire to excel as a software engineer. My primary goal is to secure an internship where I can immerse myself in real-world challenges, gather invaluable experience, and evolve into a well-rounded developer.

<h2>Get in Touch</h2>
I'm always open to new collaborations and conversations. Feel free to reach out via email to explore potential projects and partnerships.

Let's build something awesome together :)
