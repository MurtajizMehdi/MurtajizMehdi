<h1>Hi, I’m Murtajiz :)</h1>
I’m interested in web & mobile application development, UI/UX design, problem solving and anything that can make me a better developer.
I’m currently learning computer science at Florida International University.
I’m looking to collaborate on full stack web and mobile projects.
Feel free to contact me through <a href = "mailto: chicomehdi1234@gmail.com">email</a> for all collaborations!
<br>
<br>
As an aspiring software engineer, I'm driven by creativity, curiosity, and critical thinking. My current main focus is landing an internship in order to collect first hand real world experience that can make me a better and more well-rounded developer.
